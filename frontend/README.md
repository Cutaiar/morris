[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/1c2d36df-6241-4a45-a3cb-ea10ec3b210a/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/morris-cutaiar/deploys)

This package contains the component library and composition of said components into a full webpage. It is deployed live [here](https://morris-cutaiar.netlify.app/).

**Goals for this package:**

- Extremely high quality UI
- Micro-interactions
- Experimenting with uncommon patterns (like sound, stretching, creative interactions)

_This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)._

## Development

Currently using the starter scripts from CRA:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
