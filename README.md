# Morris

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/1c2d36df-6241-4a45-a3cb-ea10ec3b210a/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/morris-cutaiar/deploys)

Live site [here](https://morris-cutaiar.netlify.app/).

The goal here is to create n-men morris just for fun using typescript and react. Would be cool to have a bot play perfectly against you. Would also be cool to extend into 3 dimensions.

_This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)._

## Development

Currently using the starter scripts from CRA:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
